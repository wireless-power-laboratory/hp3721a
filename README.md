The Model 3721A Correlator is an all-digital, dc-to-250 kHz signal analyzer which combines four major measurement capabilities in one instrument. It measures autocorrelation, cross-correlation, probability distributions, and signal averaging (signal recovery), the process of recovering the waveshape of repetitive signals buried in noise -- described with reference to the Model [5480A](https://github.com/cartheur/hp5480a) Signal Analyzer. All results are displayed on a built-in CRT.

### Instrument details

All relevant details can be understood from the [manual](https://github.com/wireless-power-laboratory/hp3721a/blob/main/manual/9018-02837.pdf) and the hp [journal](https://github.com/wireless-power-laboratory/hp3721a/blob/main/hp-journal/1969-11.pdf).

### Coming Soon

Experimentation to be included as I find the time to get my units fully operational. Currently, an issue with the A20 card is holding-up progress.
