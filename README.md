The Model 3721A Correlator is an all-digital, dc-to-250 kHz signal analyzer which combines four major measurement capabilities in one instrument. It measures autocorrelation, cross-correlation, probability distributions, and signal averaging (signal recovery), the process of recovering the waveshape of repetitive signals buried in noise -- described with reference to the Model [5480A](https://github.com/cartheur/hp5480a) Signal Analyzer. All results are displayed on a built-in CRT.
